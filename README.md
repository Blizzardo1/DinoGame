# DinoGame

A Simple game written in C# using [SharpSDL3](https://github.com/Blizzardo1/SharpSDL3)

The Tileset is horrendous and can be replaced with something more pleasing.

Currently working on Cacti Generation.

Need to work on Cloud Generation, moving floor to synchronize with the Cacti, and somewhat of a pleasing background.

Code is a mess, I know. If you would like to contribute to this little project, I'm obliged to PRs.
